# Warmup Exercise: HTML

## Objectives

- review HTML
- build simple web pages

## Resources

- [Mozilla Developers Network: HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [Mozilla Developers Network: HTML Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference)

## Instructions

This directory includes the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- apple-ii.jpg
- commodore-64.jpg
- content.txt
- trs-80.jpg

Build these pages *without* the aid of graphical user interface software (i.e. Dreamweaver, Sketch, etc.) or frameworks. Write the HTML with *only* structure in mind. Do not add styles or interactivity.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**

## Tasks

1. Create a file, `index.html`. Add the document structure for your web page. This should include `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags. Add a DOCTYPE, the lang attribute to html and set a character set with `<meta>`. Make sure your code is properly nested.

2. Add the content from `content.txt` to `index.html`. You may copy and paste the text into the document (never copy and paste code).

  Text within square brackets (`[` and`]`) are notes about the content and should not appear on the page. Identify the content and format the it using appropriate semantic tags. This includes: headings, paragraphs, images, lists and tables.

  Photo caption text should be emphasized. Also emphasize categories in lists (i.e. date, price, etc.)

  Strongly emphasize the computer name (and any 'nicknames') on first reference in the paragraphs.

  Are there any abbreviations? Mark these up (first reference only), too. If you are unfamiliar with an abbreviation, look it up!

3. Build the tables in the software section. You may use the attribute/value `border="1"` to help visualize the table. (You will need to remove this attribute when you validate the code as it returns an error.)

  The first table is a basic table. Text written in CAPS should be a table heading. All other information should be considered data.

  The second table is a complex table; there will be content which span multiple rows. After building a simple version of the table, fix the first column containing "macOS"; and the last column containing "Apple" and "Linux" so these entries span multiple rows.

  The last row of the table ("* available Fall 2018") should span all columns.

4. When you have completed building the page, check to see if your page is valid using the [w3c validator](http://validator.w3.org/). If the validator returns errors (red), fix them.

  When the validator returns the message "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show." (green), you have no broken links or images, you have completed the exercise!

## How to tackle this exercise

**Read the task.**

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down the task to be completed. When you finish, check it off.

Decide on the next task to tackle.

It is okay if you get stuck. Set aside the task giving you trouble, decide on another and move on. Be sure you have written down the task giving you trouble (so you can revisit it later or ask questions).

**Good luck!**
