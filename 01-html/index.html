    <p>The <strong>Apple II</strong> (stylized as <strong>Apple ][</strong>) is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak. Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply.</p>

    <p>The computer included a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor running at 1.023 MHz, two game paddles (no longer bundled as of 1980 because they violated FCC regulations), 4 KB of RAM, an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data, and the Integer BASIC programming language built into the ROMs. To reflect the computer's color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing has rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998.</p>

    <h4>Specifications</h4>

    </ul>


    <h3>Commodore 64</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Commodore 64</strong>, also known as the <strong>C64</strong> or the <strong>CBM 64</strong>, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units.</p>

    <p>Part of the Commodore 64's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs, including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology. Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the Commodore 64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and video games.</p>

    <h4>Specifications</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Release Date</em>: August 1982</li>
      <li><em>Price</em>: $595</li>
      <li><em>Operating System</em>: Commodore BASIC</li>
      <li><em>CPU</em>: MOS 6510</li>
      <li><em>Memory</em>: 64KB</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>TRS-80</h3>

    <p>The <strong>TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80)</strong> is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores. The name is an abbreviation of Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor. It was one of the earliest mass-produced and mass-marketed retail personal computers.</p>

    <p>An extensive line of upgrades and add-on hardware peripherals for the TRS-80 was developed and marketed by Tandy/Radio Shack. The basic system could be expanded with up to 48 KB of RAM (in 16 KB increments), and up to four floppy disk drives and/or hard disk drives. Tandy/Radio Shack provided full-service support including upgrade, repair, and training services in their thousands of stores worldwide.</p>

    <h4>Specifications</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Release Date</em>: July 1980</li>
      <li><em>Price</em>: $699</li>
      <li><em>Operating System</em>: BASIC</li>
      <li><em>CPU</em>: Zilog Z-80</li>
      <li><em>Memory</em>: 4KB to 48KB</li>
    </ul>
