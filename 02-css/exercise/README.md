## Objectives

- debug existing HTML code
- review use of directory paths

## Resources

## Instructions

This directory includes the following files:

- README.md (this file)
- img
  - vintage-hardware.jpg
  - vintage-software.jpg
- index.html

Build these pages *without* the aid of graphical user interface software (i.e. Dreamweaver, Sketch, etc.) or frameworks.

**Never copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**


## Tasks

1. Review the HTML. Are there broken links? Broken images? Does the code [validate](http://validator.w3.org/)? Before adding CSS, check these first.

  Other than correcting any validation errors, broken links/images or adding a link to your style sheet, you **MAY NOT** modify any of the HTML.

2. Create a new directory called `css` inside the `02-css` directory. Next, create a style sheet named `style.css`. Save this file in the `css` directory you just created. Link to the style sheet in `index.html`.

3. Set the `body` font size to 14 pixels, the font-family to a sans-serif typeface (you may choose to use a specific typeface or the generic default), font color to `#222` and the line height to `1.5`.

4. Set the `header` to have a background color of `#eee`.

5. Set `em` tags within the `header` to have a font weight of bold.

6. Set `a` tags within the `header` to have a background color of `#eee` and a font color of `#444`. `a:hover` tags within `header` should have a background color of `#444` and the color should be `#eee`.

7. Within the `aside`, set `img` to have a border width of 3 pixels, a border style of `solid` and a border color of `#222`.

8. Set the `em` tags inside the `aside` to have a font style of `italic`, a font color of `#999` and a font size of 10 pixels.

9. Let's add unique styles to each section. Under `#hardware`, the `h2` should have a font color of `rgb(218,58,51)`. Apply the same color the `img` border. Under `#software`, apply the same rules, but using the color `rgb(21,88,218)`.

10. Set the `footer` to have background color of `#222` and a font color of `#eee`.

11. Set `a` tags within the `footer` to have a font color of `#eee` and `a:hover` tags to have a font color of `#444`.

12. Set the `small` content inside `footer` to have a font size of 10 pixels.


## How to tackle this exercise

**Read the task.**

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down the task to be completed. When you finish, check it off.

Decide on the next task to tackle.

It is okay if you get stuck. Set aside the task giving you trouble, decide on another and move on. Be sure you have written down the task giving you trouble (so you can revisit it later or ask questions).

**Good luck!**
